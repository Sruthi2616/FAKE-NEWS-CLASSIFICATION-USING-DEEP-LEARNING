The company has recently begun constructing its first European parts manufacturing site in Sheffield, northern England, and Britain has warned that Boeing might miss out on future business over the row.\\n\\u201cBoeing has a reputation in this country that was beginning to grow in a positive way, through the investment in Sheffield and elsewhere,\\u201d Clark said.\\n\\u201cTo jeopardize that reputation and relationship by doing something that is completely unjustified is something that I don\\u2019t regard as being in the strategic interests of Boeing.\\u201d\",\n          \"Colin Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since March when he opted out of his San Francisco 49ers contract\\n\\\"This is what lynchings look like in 2016.\\\"\\nA video accompanies Colin Kaepernick's Instagram post.

He leads them to the Super Bowl two years later, but they lose to the Baltimore Ravens.\\nHe continues to read widely - about the civil rights movement and post-colonial theory, Malcom X's autobiography and Franz Fanon's The Wretched Of The Earth.\\nHe begins to attend classes at the University of California, Berkeley, having befriended Ameer Hasan Loggins, who is working towards his doctorate in African Diaspora Studies.\\nIn August, Loggins wrote an article for The Athletic about their relationship. He compared Kaepernick to Ella Baker, the civil rights activist who died in 1986, aged 83.\\n\\\"She was a civil/human rights leader that was invested in developing a leaderful movement,\\\" Loggins wrote. \\\"She pushed the folks to politicise and mobilise the people via group-centred leadership.\\n\\\"Here I am, taking leadership cues from Ella Baker, and next thing I know I am in the inner circle of a passionate, intelligent and conscious NFL star with a tremendous heart and a righteous indignation over the treatment of the oppressed.\\n\\\"I met Kaepernick before he became a cultural icon and a lightning rod for both hope and hatred.\\n\\\"People that trace our connection to UC Berkeley assume he became politicised in my class. But Colin was aware, focused, well-read, eager to learn.\\\"\\nAnd then came three days in July last year.\\nThe perilous fight\\nThe singer pauses, hanging between verses. He knows - like the thousands standing around him in the stands, on the pitch and on the stage - that the Star-Spangled Banner, the American national anthem, is about to reach its highest point.\\nKaepernick is on the team bench. Sandwiched between two giant soft-drink barrels, he sits alone as thousands roar and whoop in appreciation.\\n\\\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\\\" he says after the pre-season match in August 2016.\\n\\\"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\\\"\\nKaepernick, with his shirt number slightly obscured, is by the orange drinks cart\\nThis is not his first protest. But it is his first protest in team kit. And it is the first time he is asked about it.\\nHis silent, solitary gesture of solidarity makes a lot of people very angry. One of those is Nate Boyer. He used to be in the US Army Special Forces and is a former NFL player.\\n\\\"When I saw that, I felt like I was betrayed. It just hurt. It was extremely disgraceful for me. In my eyes you might as well burn the flag,\\\" he told the BBC.\\n\\\"That was my initial reaction before I stopped and thought: 'What is he so upset about that he would want to protest the symbol of what our country stands for - which is freedom of rights?'\\\"\\nBoyer decides to write an open letter to Kaepernick. And they meet.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Colin Kaepernick 'has potential to be icon' - Nate Boyer\\nThe NFL star - in 2014 he signed a contract that would have been worth up to $126m (\\u00a395.8m) over six years - actually sends a taxi to take Boyer from San Diego to San Francisco, about an eight-hour drive along the California coast.\\n\\\"I wanted him to stand - but I wanted him to stand because he feels like we are going in the right direction, like things are changing,\\\" Boyer says of their meeting.\\n\\\"I wanted him to understand the implications of what he was doing, and he listened. That was important, because we are at a time when people just shake their fists instead of trying to fix something together. We reached a position of consensus.\\\"\\nA week later, Kaepernick protests again. This time he is joined by his team-mate Eric Reid, and both men kneel while the national anthem plays.\\nBoyer, (far right) stands with his hand on his heart as the anthem plays. Kaerpernick kneels with team-mate Eric Reid (left)\\nBoyer stands next to them. On the same night, at another match, Jeremy Lane of the Seattle Seahawks remains seated for the anthem. The movement is growing.\\n\\\"It took courage for him to sit initially. It took more courage to bend his position a little bit,\\\" Boyer adds.\\n\\\"I told him if they knelt I would be next to them with my hand on my heart, because I support your right to peacefully protest in this country. That is what I fought for.\\\"\\n'I guess that makes me a proud bitch!'\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Mr Trump attacked dissenting players at a rally in Alabama\\nIn late September, two matches in to the 2017 NFL season, President Donald Trump makes a speech.\\nHe says players who refuse to stand for the national anthem are \\\"sons of bitches\\\" who should be fired by their teams.\\nThe reaction to his words could not be more divided.\\nThere is support from many - who find the protest disrespectful - and there is condemnation from many others.\\nKaepernick's mother tweets: \\\"I guess that makes me a proud bitch!\\\"\\nNBA star LeBron James describes Trump as a \\\"bum\\\".\\nOver the weekend of 24-25 September, never before had the protest of refusing to stand during the national anthem attracted such attention. Scores of athletes, managers and coaches - across several sports - performed some kind of protest or gesture of solidarity while the national anthem played before their games.\\nSome linked arms, some stayed in the dressing room, many knelt. Travis Kelce of Kansas City Chiefs became the most prominent white player to kneel.\\n\\\"I will be proud of it until the day I die,\\\" he told BBC Sport.\\n\\\"Hopefully it creates talk and creates change. It's very important for this to actually become a change in society instead of it just being a badge on NFL players for making a protest.\\\"\\nBut players find themselves having to explain what their actions mean.\\nMany NFL supporters and the US public in general view the players as being unpatriotic, disrespectful of American values and/or the US military, and they agree with what Trump said.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Chiefs fans divided over players kneeling\\nOutside the stadiums, fans tell the BBC:\\n\\\"I'm 100% against it and 100% behind Trump. I don't come out to the football games to see political views. This is not the venue for the protest. I will boo them.\\\"\\n\\\"They need to respect the flag.\\\"\\n\\\"The message was never about the anthem, the message is about police brutality against African-Americans and that seems to have been lost.\\\"\\nEric Reid, who first kneeled with Kaepernick a year before, writes in the New York Times: \\\"It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel. We chose it because it's exactly the opposite.\\n\\\"It has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society, which includes the right to speak out in protest.\\\"\\nBut Kaepernick himself is absent. Why?\\n'A prisoner of the moment'\\nTwo NFL players walk into a computer game shop. It's not a joke, this really happened:\\nKeith Marshall and Rob Kelley of the Washington Redskins were in Dulles, just outside the nation's capital, when they saw a young boy wearing Kaepernick's number seven San Francisco 49ers jersey. They complimented him on it.\\nIn conversation, the 10-year-old Jaden explains why he is there. He has been saving up for an Xbox, and is keeping tabs on the price - he can't yet afford it.\\nSo they buy it for him - with his grandma's permission of course.\\nJaden explains why he has a Kaepernick jersey.\\n\\\"I liked how he wasn't afraid to show what he thought. He risked getting fired, which was a big thing. I wouldn't even do that, but he did, and I really like him for standing out.\\n\\\"I don't know if people agree with it, but he just doesn't care what people say and that's inspired me and probably inspired other people.\\\"\\nMarshall and Kelley also bought Jaden a game - but it wasn't Madden, the official NFL computer game.\\nHad it been, Jaden would not have found his favourite player. Kaepernick is no longer in the game. In March, he opted out of his contract with the 49ers. He is now 29 years old and a free agent. But off the pitch, he is busy.\\n\\\"His family is probably able to do whatever they want, but not everybody is able to have the stuff that we have the luxury of having,\\\" said Kelley (right)\\nHe has been donating money to various charities and projects across the United States - he has pledged to donate $1m (\\u00a3750,000) in total - and has helped set up an educational campaign called Know Your Rights.\\nIn late September, Sports Illustrated published a front cover on how sport has united following Trump's speech.\\nThere was no Kaepernick there either.\\nHe is not injured, and should still be capable of performing at the highest level. He has not spoken to the media for months. There are reports that team owners are refusing to sign him - despite coaches wanting to.\\nNBA star Steph Curry was featured on the cover, after he said he would not accept an invitation to the White House. Trump later said Curry had been 'uninvited'.\\nColin Kaepernick was not featured on the front of this month's Sports Illustrated magazine\\nWhen he was asked about Kaepernick's omission from the Sports Illustrated front cover, Curry described him as \\\"a prisoner of the moment\\\".\\n\\\"That was terrible,\\\" he said. \\\"The real people who are understanding exactly what's going on and who's really been active and vocal and truly making a difference, if you don't have Kaepernick front and centre on that, something's wrong.\\\"\\nBoyer, who was there when Kaepernick 'took a knee' for the first time, has not spoken to him for a while either - not since the Super Bowl, in February.\\nHe says that \\\"there was never any falling out as such\\\", but he does worry about him \\\"being pulled so far in one direction that there is never going to be any room to grow and really move forward\\\".\\nHe believes Kaepernick \\\"may never play again\\\" but adds: \\\"I don't fear that, because he is in a much more important position now.\\n\\\"If he is able to embrace those who disagree with him and love them, much like Martin Luther King did, then Colin has the potential to be something like that.\\n\\\"He could be the face of something and really move this conversation forward - if he is willing to listen.\\n\\\"It is going to take swallowing of pride and humility, but I would rather see him move into this realm than play again, because he has been quiet for a long time.\\n\\\"We need you to be a part of this because you started this.\\\"\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Trump comments 'inflammatory' - Kraft\\nWhere will it end?

'Her soil is her fortune.'\\nIt is a small agricultural town, inland from the opulent coastal resort of Palm Beach, where Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence is situated.\\nBelle Glade and its surrounding area is known as Muck City, population about 20,000. It is also a hotbed for American football talent.\\nGlades Central High School counts dozens of NFL players among its alumni\\nOn Friday night, 17-year-old Kortney Ware was among the Glades Central Raiders lining up to face a team from Lake Worth, down on the coast. They won 50-8. Before the match, as the anthem played, Ware took a knee.\\n\\\"I did it for the police brutality,\\\" he told BBC Sport's Richard Conway.\\n\\\"People have got to speak up. I am tired of seeing us black people killed, especially young people. Every day somebody black getting killed for little stuff. It's tough for us black people. So we're standing up.\\\"\\nSome schools in the United States have vowed to punish players who refuse to stand for the national anthem.\\nAnd on Tuesday, reports suggested NFL owners, at a league meeting next week, are planning to introduce rules to force players to stand.\\nThe Raiders' coach, Jessie Hester, himself a former NFL player, says he \\\"fully supports\\\" the protests, and his players' right to do the same.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'I'm sick of young black men being killed'\\n\\\"There are no better people to do it than stars,\\\" he adds.\\n\\\"There is social injustice in this country that we need to address and the guys in the NFL have a platform. People listen to them.\\n\\\"These players here will want them to continue to speak out and be heard, because that's the only way change can happen.\\\"\\nWare says Kaepernick was \\\"definitely\\\" an inspiration, and he hopes the influence of his kneel gesture will continue to grow.\\n\\\"A lot of people are doing it now. Even the managers doing it too. That's amazingly successful,\\\" he adds.\\n\\\"This will lead to better things, open people's eyes. We need even more people doing what we doing. Everybody speak up.

Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.\\u201d\\nCast member Bryan Cranston (R) and director Richard Linklater pose with festival director Claire Stewart as they arrive for the premiere of \\\"Last Flag Flying\\\" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\\n\\u201cLast Flag Flying\\u201d was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic \\u201cBefore Sunset\\u201d trilogy and the 2014 \\u201cBoyhood\\u201d which won a slew of Oscar nominations.\\nLinklater also made comedies including \\u201cSchool of Rock\\u201d and \\u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\\u201d, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. \\u201cLast Flag Flying\\u201d falls somewhere between the two genres.\\nCast member Bryan Cranston (R) poses with director Richard Linklater as they arrive for the premiere of \\\"Last Flag Flying\\\" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\\nThe drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.\\nSteve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in \\u2018Nam.\\nVanity Fair\\u2019s Richard Lawson said the film\\u2019s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit \\u201can Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.\\u201d\\nOther critics said \\u201cLast Flag Flying\\u201d lacked the light touch of Linklater\\u2019s best work.

Mr. Corker responded on Twitter an hour later, saying that the White House had become an \\u201cadult day care center.\\u201d\\nHe then unloaded in an interview with The New York Times, saying in public what many of his Republican colleagues say in private \\u2014 that the president is dangerously erratic, treats his high office like \\u201ca reality show,\\u201d has to be contained by his staff and is reckless enough to put the country \\u201con the path to World War III.\\u201d\\nMr. Corker, a moderate by temperament as well as ideology, had measured his occasional criticisms of Mr. Trump for months in hopes of influencing his foreign policy, but evidently feels liberated now that he has decided not to run for a third term.\\nFew other incumbent Republicans rushed to the microphones to echo his comments on Monday, but several made little attempt to hide their irritation at Mr. Trump for attacking Mr. Corker.\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s an important part of our team, and he\\u2019s a particularly important part of the budget debate, which will be on the floor next week,\\u201d Mr. McConnell said pointedly at an event in Hazard, Ky., with Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\u201cBob Corker has been a leader in Congress on issues as diverse as deficit reduction and combating terrorism, and he is a man of unwavering integrity,\\u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement. \\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to accomplish our economic and national security agenda we\\u2019re going to have to work together, period.\\u201d\\nMr. McConnell\\u2019s associates were blunter in expressing the leadership\\u2019s frustration with the president for disrupting party unity as Republicans push for tax cuts. \\u201cThis was going to be hard no matter what,\\u201d said Billy Piper, Mr. McConnell\\u2019s former chief of staff. \\u201cAnd he took the guy who was one of the linchpins of this and incinerated him for no reason.\\u201d\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThe White House spent Monday telling allies that Mr. Corker was responsible for the fight, not Mr. Trump, and that the senator was an attention-seeking obstructionist.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It adds to their ability and their cover to speak about the president of the United States in ways that no president should be talked about.\\u201d\\nVice President Mike Pence was left to defend Mr. Trump against what he called \\u201cempty rhetoric and baseless attacks,\\u201d saying the president had accomplished a lot internationally. \\u201cToday our nation once again stands without apology as leader of the free world,\\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what American leadership on the world stage looks like and no amount of criticism at home can diminish those results.\\u201d\\nMr. Trump has grown frustrated by Senate Republicans \\u2014 including lashing out at Mr. McConnell for not getting the job done \\u2014 as legislation to repeal President Barack Obama\\u2019s health care program has been repeatedly blocked. He has engaged in open conflicts with Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others, although just Monday he went golfing with Mr. Graham.\\nSome Republican senators share Mr. Trump\\u2019s frustration with gridlock in the Senate. \\u201cWe want things to move quickly,\\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who was elected in 2014. \\u201cPeople are frustrated with the lack of results.\\u201d\\nSenator David Perdue of Georgia, another member of the 2014 class, has been even more outspoken in venting about fellow Republicans derailing health care legislation. \\u201cPeople are very upset that Republican senators are not backing the agenda of this president,\\u201d he said.\\nMr. Trump\\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, acting in what he says is the president\\u2019s interest, is organizing a rebellion against the Republican establishment and recruiting candidates to challenge incumbent senators in primaries next year. \\u201cThis is what they think about President Trump behind closed doors,\\u201d Mr. Bannon said on Fox News on Monday night, referring to Mr. Corker\\u2019s comments and calling on the senator to resign. Mr. Pence\\u2019s chief of staff has talked about a \\u201cpurge\\u201d of Republicans who are not loyal to Mr. Trump.\\nThat may keep more Republicans on board even if they agree with Mr. Corker.\\n\\u201cDo most senators have their doubts about the president?\\u201d asked John Feehery, a longtime Republican congressional aide. \\u201cThat\\u2019s probably true, but also largely irrelevant. He\\u2019s the president, and they have to find ways to get stuff done with him. Otherwise, they face the wrath of the voters \\u2014 something Bob Corker no longer worries about.\\u201d\\nIn effect, Mr. McCain, Ms. Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins of Maine already were free agents on many issues. Regular defections by Mr. Corker would make the president\\u2019s ability to pass legislation that much harder, absent bipartisan deals with Democrats.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker could block the confirmation of a new secretary of state should Mr. Trump push out his embattled chief diplomat, Rex W. Tillerson. He also, presumably, would play a key role in any decision on whether to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 frustrations with Trump are starting to boil over,\\u201d said Alex Conant, a former Senate Republican aide. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure the feelings are mutual inside the White House. The relationship was always tenuous at best, but Corker\\u2019s comments are a new low point.\\u201d\\n\\u201cIf they were getting a lot done, it would be easier for everyone to get along,\\u201d Mr. Conant said. \\u201cOf course, the fact that they\\u2019re not getting along also makes it harder to get anything done.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.\\nThe government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.\\nThe House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: \\u201cGranting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.\\u201d\\nCNN explained, \\u201cThis law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.\\u201d\\nThe new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we\\u2019re happy to get them out,\\u201d Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. \\u201cI\\u2019m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we\\u2019ll get our money.\\u201d\\nHowever, buried within the bill\\u2019s text is a daunting \\u201cone major red flag\\u201d that would give the newly formed commission \\u201cthe authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System \\u2018without limitation\\u2019 and without a warrant, for the purpose of \\u2018making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,\\u201d The Free Thought Project reported.\\nThe legislation reads:\\nIn performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.\\nOnly five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn\\u2019t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can\\u2019t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn\\u2019t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.\\nOnly 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB \\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad)\\nA scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, \\u201cWhile it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.\\u201d\\nAaron Kesel writes for Activist Post and is Director of Content for Coinivore.
